Hi everyone,

I'm excited to share my latest project, "Match the Cards," with all of you. "Match the Cards" is a fun and challenging game that tests your memory and cognitive skills. You can check it out by following this link: https://phaneendra73.github.io/MatchTheCards/.

I built this game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm really proud of the result. The game taught me many concepts and improved my logic and how to build it step by step.

Playing "Match the Cards" is easy - all you have to do is click on two cards to flip them over, and try to match pairs of cards with the same image. The game is great for all ages and is an excellent way to exercise your brain and improve your memory skills.

I had a lot of fun creating "Match the Cards," and I hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it. Let me know what you think, and if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. Thanks for your support!
